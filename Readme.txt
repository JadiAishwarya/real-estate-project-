# Real Estate Forecasting and Optimization using Deep Learning

This project showcases a complete data science pipeline for forecasting real estate prices and optimizing retail property investment using deep learning and linear programming.

## 📊 Features
- LSTM for retail price time-series forecasting
- CNN for property image classification (high/low potential)
- Portfolio optimization using Linear Programming (PuLP)
- Designed to be run on Google Colab

## 🧪 Models Used
- `LSTM`: Predicts future property prices from historical data.
- `CNN`: Classifies property images into high or low investment potential.
- `Linear Programming`: Optimizes investment allocation across properties.
